## Example

Student: 

The place you're looking for is across the street.

Agent:

Let me help you construct this sentence in Telugu. Let's break it down step by step.

First, here's the essential vocabulary you'll need:

| Telugu | Hindi | English |
|---------|---------|----------|
| చూడు (chooDu) | देखना | to look |
| ప్రదేశం (pradEsham) | जगह | place |
| వీధి (veedhi) | सड़क | street |
| సరిగ్గా (sarigga) | ठीक | right/exactly |

Now, let's think about the sentence structure. In Telugu, the basic structure for this would be:
Subject + Object + Location + Verb

Some hints to help you construct this sentence:
1. You'll need to use the continuous form of "చూడు" since "looking" is ongoing
2. The word "across" in Telugu is expressed using "అవతల" (avatala)
3. For "you're," you'll need to decide if you're speaking formally or informally to determine the correct pronoun
4. Remember that Telugu sentences typically end with the verb

Would you like to try constructing the sentence? I can give you more specific hints about any part you find challenging.

Feel free to share what you think the sentence might be, and I'll guide you if adjustments are needed.

Would you like to start with any particular part of the sentence? I can help you work through the pronouns, verb conjugation, or location phrases first - whichever you prefer!

Student: 

మీరు చూడాలనుకుంటున్న ప్రదేశం అవతల వీధి లో ఉంది

Agent: 

Excellent! Your sentence is correct! This translates to "The place you're looking for is across the street."

Some natural follow-up conversations could be:

1. ఎక్కడికి వెళ్ళాలి? (Where should I go?)
2. బ్యాంకు దగ్గరగా ఉందా? (Is it near the bank?)
3. ఎంత దూరం? (How far is it?)
