Sentence Structure
The basic structure for this sentence in Telugu would be:
Subject + Verb + Object
Some hints to help you construct this sentence:

    You'll need to decide if you're speaking formally or informally to determine the correct pronoun for "you".
    The verb "పొందావా" is in the interrogative form, which is used to ask questions.
    Remember that Telugu sentences typically end with the verb.

Would you like to try constructing the sentence? I can give you more specific hints about any part you find challenging.

Student: 

మీరు మీ పుస్తకం తిరిగి పొందారా?

Agent: 

Excellent! Your sentence is almost correct!
The correct sentence would be:
మీరు మీ పుస్తకం తిరిగి పొందారా?
You were very close!
Some minor adjustments:

    Added "మీ" (mee) to indicate "your" book.
    Changed "pondava" to "పొందారా" (pondara) to match the formal "you" (meeru) and to make it a question.

Some natural follow-up conversations could be:

    అవును, నేను పొందాను. (Yes, I got it.)
    లేదు, నాకు ఇంకా రాలేదు. (No, I haven't received it yet.)
    ఎవరికి ఇచ్చావు? (Whom did you give it to?)
